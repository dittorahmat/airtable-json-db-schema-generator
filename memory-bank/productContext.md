## Detailed Plan

1.  **Data Model:**
    *   The core entities will likely include:
        *   `Client`: Represents the client (e.g., "French Language School").
        *   `Teacher`: Represents a teacher.
        *   `Student`: Represents a student.
        *   `Cohort`: Represents a group cohort of students.
        *   `ClassSession`: Represents a single class session.
    *   Relationships:
        *   A `Client` has many `Teacher`s.
        *   A `Client` has many `Student`s.
        *   A `Teacher` can teach many `ClassSession`s.
        *   A `Student` can enroll in many `Cohort`s.
        *   A `Cohort` has many `ClassSession`s.
        *   A `ClassSession` has one `Teacher`.
        *   A `ClassSession` belongs to one `Cohort`.

2.  **UI Components:**
    *   Input Area: A text area where the user can input the client description.
    *   Clarification Chat: A chat window where the AI asks clarifying questions and the user provides answers.
    *   Database Understanding: A section that displays the AI's understanding of the database tables and relationships.
    *   Workflows List: A section that displays the AI's list of workflows, sorted by table/entity.
    *   Airtable JSON: A section that displays the generated Airtable API JSON.

3.  **AI Role:**
    *   The AI will use the Gemini 2.0 Flash model to:
        *   Understand the client description and identify the relevant entities and relationships.
        *   Ask clarifying questions to fill in any missing information.
        *   Generate the database schema based on the identified entities and relationships.
        *   Generate the list of workflows based on the database schema.
        *   Generate the Airtable API JSON.

4.  **Workflow Generation:**
    *   The AI will generate workflows for each entity, including:
        *   Adding a new entity.
        *   Modifying an existing entity.
        *   Deleting an entity.
        *   Listing all entities.
        *   Searching for entities.
    *   The AI will also generate workflows for relationships, including:
        *   Adding a new relationship.
        *   Modifying an existing relationship.
        *   Deleting an existing relationship.

5.  **Airtable API JSON Generation:**
    *   The AI will generate the Airtable API JSON based on the database schema.
    *   The JSON will include the necessary information to create the tables and relationships in Airtable.
    *   The JSON will be directly executable.

6.  **Technology Stack:**
    *   Next.js
    *   Tailwind CSS
    *   Shadcn
    *   @google/generative-ai

7.  **Deployment:**
    *   Vercel

        *   `Client`: Represents the client (e.g., "French Language School").
        *   `Teacher`: Represents a teacher.
        *   `Student`: Represents a student.
        *   `Cohort`: Represents a group cohort of students.
        *   `ClassSession`: Represents a single class session.
    *   Relationships:
        *   A `Client` has many `Teacher`s.
        *   A `Client` has many `Student`s.
        *   A `Teacher` can teach many `ClassSession`s.
        *   A `Student` can enroll in many `Cohort`s.
        *   A `Cohort` has many `ClassSession`s.
        *   A `ClassSession` has one `Teacher`.

2.  **UI Components:**
    *   Input Area: A text area where the user can input the client description.
    *   Clarification Chat: A chat window where the AI asks clarifying questions and the user provides answers.
    *   Database Understanding: A section that displays the AI's understanding of the database tables and relationships.
    *   Workflows List: A section that displays the AI's list of workflows, sorted by table/entity.
    *   Airtable JSON: A section that displays the generated Airtable API JSON.

3.  **AI Role:**
    *   The AI will use the Gemini 2.0 Flash model to:
        *   Understand the client description and identify the relevant entities and relationships.
        *   Ask clarifying questions to fill in any missing information.
        *   Generate the database schema based on the identified entities and relationships.
        *   Generate the list of workflows based on the database schema.
        *   Generate the Airtable API JSON.

4.  **Workflow Generation:**
    *   The AI will generate workflows for each entity, including:
        *   Adding a new entity.

        *   Deleting an entity.
        *   Listing all entities.
        *   Searching for entities.
    *   The AI will also generate workflows for relationships, including:
        *   Adding a new relationship.
        *   Modifying an existing relationship.
        *   Deleting an existing relationship.

5.  **Airtable API JSON Generation:**
    *   The AI will generate the Airtable API JSON based on the database schema.
    *   The JSON will include the necessary information to create the tables and relationships in Airtable.
    *   The JSON will be directly executable.

6.  **Technology Stack:**
    *   Next.js
    *   Tailwind CSS
    *   Shadcn
    *   @google/generative-ai
